# SEO
SEO (search engine optimization) is how to increase search engine ranking, compared to other websites. There are those who specialize in SEO tactics, though there are basic steps that can be done to increase SEO ranking for any website. As Google changes their SEO algorithm on a regular basis, staying up-to-date with the latest tactics and following the general best practices will help.

## Best practices:
* Ensure heading tags are used appropriately with your content. Important information should be used with the H1 tag.
* There should only be one H1 tag per page.
* Quality backlinks (links to and out of your website) can help SEO results.
* Keep up with the latest trends in SEO optimization and check best practices from sites like Moz annually.

## Tactics to avoid:
* Do not use ghost pages or hidden text to improve SEO score.
* Do not use too many backlinks or place them randomly. Strive for quality links combined with good content and structure.

## Ideal SEO implementation
* SEO planning: What do we want to highlight? Who are our customers and what are their goals?
* Use a keyword research tool. What search terms are used to find us?
* Set up keywords in headers and optimize meta descriptions.
* Set up Google Analytics account for site and review on a regular basis. See what users are clicking on or avoiding.
* Set up a heat map to trace where users move their mouse on the page.
